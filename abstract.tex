		This paper presents the outcome of my internship at SII in the context of my last year of formation in Information Technology Security provided by the institute INSA Centre Val de Loire. This internship falls in line with previous works promoting robotics within the Research \& Development department of the SII Bourges agency. In this context of rapid development of artificial intelligence, we propose a robotic system capable of simultaneously mapping its environment and detecting surrounding objects of interest. This system, called \gls{robo}, is dedicated to perform recognition missions in dangerous environments,
